            <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
            <p>
              After reading the article, i have the temptation to write off progressive enhancement as
              a relic of the browser wars. I mean, who turns off JS today? Is that even possible (it is)?
              Auto-updates have made outdated browsers a thing of the past (they're all chromium anyway lol). However, i'd argue that the
              ideas in the article are more important today in the age of the overengineered web. We
              have a million options available to us now to complicate webpages. HTML5 alone can do
              things that were only available through plugins in times past. CSS can do what required
              JS before. On top of that, there are frameworks available for every use case. I
              understand progressive enhancement as taking care to build semantic webpages, utilizing
              the proper features of each persona of the "web trinity" before adding complexity, i.e. build a
              semantic navigation bar using the HTML5 nav element wrapped in a header element, with
              any animations or collapsing behaviors added via CSS beginning with the mobile layout
              in mind, finally bringing in JS only where absolutely necessary for dynamic
              interactions. This will result in cleaner markup and a more consistent experience across
              devices.<br/>
              <br/>

            <h2>Dragon Project Revision</h2>
            <p>
              For my dragon microsite revision, I decided to do something entirely different. I'd used Bootstrap
              to put together the initial draft. I took a template built by w3schools.com for a band website,
              stripped out the pieces I did't need and modified the rest to build what amounted to a pretty
              good looking modern site. The design cues that Boostrap helped make popular on the modern Web
              were pretty apparent as the result, style-wise, wasn't too far from what you might expect from the real SpaceX
              webisite. Boostrap's classes and components made it easy and enjoyable to build a product page like
              this. I gave my wife the URL to the page and told her to check it out. She visited it it from her phone.
              She immediately noticed that the text was weirdly squashed horizontally and didn't look good at all. I
              started to freak out, but she casually commented, "There's probably just too much padding on the container."
              I turned to my laptop where I had the site open in my browser, right-clicked to inspect one of the areas of
              text, and hovered it in the Elements tab and nearly the whole thing turned bright green, indicating a lot of
              padding around the text. I went into the CSS and made one change, pushed it to Github, and all was well on mobile.
              She has always been able to fix my code like that.
              <br>
              <br>
              Fast-forward to the final revision, and I decided to stay away from my wife and her eye. I decided to
              consult my alter-ego. I decided that all the slick Apple-esque design that Bootstrap had made possible had to go.
              I decided to create the SpaceX Dragon BBS. To navigate, you enter your menu selection in a small text input that accepts
              only a single value and hit enter. It is beautiful. It is me. Then my lovely wife found it. She told me she was
              afraid for my grade. I told her it would be fine. She opened the site on her phone again and suggested that even
              if I was choosing the path of self-destruction, I could at least turn the menu items into links so that on mobile
              it was easy to navigate. "No.", I said, firmly. BBSes were primitive. Real man navigate by textbox. I held this
              stance for 24 hours and caved. She was right, adding links made the mobile experience much better. So there it is,
              Dragon final in all its glory.
